📈 Dynamic Pricing & Revenue Optimization using Time Series Forecasting
🚀 End-to-End Data Analytics + AI/ML + Business Intelligence Project

This project applies Time Series Forecasting and a Dynamic Pricing Strategy to optimize revenue based on predicted customer demand. It demonstrates how businesses can maximize profit by adjusting pricing according to demand behavior using real-world analytical techniques.

🧠 Problem Statement

Revenue loss occurs when companies charge the same price regardless of demand fluctuations.
Using forecasting, we predict future demand and apply dynamic pricing to:

Increase price when demand is high

Decrease price when demand is low
→ leading to higher overall revenue 🚀

🎯 Project Objectives

Forecast product demand using Time Series analysis

Apply dynamic pricing strategy to maximize revenue

Compare revenue before vs after optimization

Build interactive BI dashboard for business decisions

📊 Pipeline Workflow
Data → Cleaning → Time Series Forecasting → Dynamic Pricing Strategy
→ Revenue Optimization → Visualization → Insights & KPIs

📈 Forecasting & Pricing Strategy
📌 Dynamic Pricing Rule
Condition	Price Strategy
Forecast > Average	Increase price by 10%
Forecast < Average	Decrease price by 10%
🧪 Model Evaluation
Metric Used: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Lower MAE → Better performance
